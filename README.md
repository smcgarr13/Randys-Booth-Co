## Description
An application that helps schedule, keep track of inventory and special order needs, quote projects and allows to see where a project is in real time

## Installation
Clone repo: https://github.com/smcgarr13/Randys-Booth-Co

## Usage
Login: TBD

Employees/emails: TBD

Quotes: TBD

Projects: User can click on the link in the nav bar to be redirected to a page with all the available projects. Each project will show some basic information to help differentiate between each other. Website functionality has not been implemented to delete, create and edit models but request can be made using API building tools such as Insomnia to make requests to the server. 

Requests: TBD,  Website functionality has not been implemented to delete, create and edit models but request can be made using API building tools such as Insomnia to make requests to the server. 

Inventory: the user can click on each category name/card and they will be redirected to a page with all of the inventory items that fall under that category name. The user can add a new inventory item by entering the necessary information in the input fields of the blank card on the page. When the user clicks "add" a new inventory card will populate accordingly.

## Future improvements
Inventory: we'd like to improve the edit function so it properly saves the edited information. We'd also like to add an order function to each item so the user can order additional units if needed for their project.

Search Function: we'd like to make the search feature @ footer functional so the user can search for projects and inventory items by name or id number.

Projects: Add more references betweenn models so that user can tailor what projects and information is shown. Add inventory for each active product so that users can better track inventory use. Implement a add project htmml page for better user interface. Alter url requests to take in string inputs to help match the company's project number structure. 

Request: Implement a npm package to help output information into different type of files. As well as implement a translate npm package that uses google translate api to change documents from english to spanish. Improve references between models and work on a template for outputting request information as files to help speed up the project process. In addition to adding translation parameters for customization of what needs to be transalted. Packages will also need to be applied to emails. 

Schedule: Create handlebar for a timeline of projects using the information stored in the schedule model.
