## Description
An application that helps schedule, keep track of inventory and special order needs, quote projects and allows to see where a project is in real time

## Installation
Clone repo: https://github.com/smcgarr13/Randys-Booth-Co

## Usage

Projects: TBD

Inventory: the user can click on each category name an you will be redirected to a page with all of the inventory items that fall under that category name.

Future improvements:
Inventory: we'd like to add an order function to each item so the user can order additional units if needed for their project.

Search Function: we'd like to make the search feature @ footer functional so the user can search for projects and inventory items by name or id number.
